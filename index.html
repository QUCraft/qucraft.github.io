		<h2 class="uk-tile-default">About</h2>
		<p>
			This server (Java edition) was created with the main goal being to re-create the campus (West included) in Minecraft. It serves as a common place for past, current, and future Queen’s students to come together and enjoy the sense of community that has been abruptly taken away this spring.
			There is a system in place where each player can specify their year and faculty that is displayed in the chat when talking to others in-game. This gives a sense of students talking to students rather than just strangers.					
		</p>		
		<p>
			The layout of the university district and surrounding area (roads, 2D building shapes, elevation, etc) was imported as a template for the campus recreation project. This makes it quite easy for new players to locate and determine the appropriate scale for the building(s) they want to build. This way everything is very close to the real campus even though it is being built by many different people.
			Visit the <a href="https://map.qucraft.me" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online map</a> to see the current progress.
		</p>	
		<p >
			In addition to the campus recreation project, there is also a survival world for a more casual experience. Players are free to switch between these two separate worlds at any time and may choose to play in one or both of these worlds.
